# Lawjay's UX Portfolio

![Profile Picture](./assets/profile.jpeg)

I'm Lawjay Lee, a third-year computer science major. I have been playing around with web development since I was in sixth grade, but I never felt truly satisfied with their usability. I hope that I could apply the principles I will learn in this course and create better websites and apps for others.
